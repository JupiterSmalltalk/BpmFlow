An exclusive gateway evaluates the state of the business process andbased on the conditionbreaks the flow into one of the two or more mutually exclusive paths. Remember that the exclusive in "exclusive gateway" stands for mutually exclusive.

Splitting: the flow will go down only one of the paths that originate in the Gateway; the selection will be made after evaluating the conditions defined for the Gateway (there will be one per each path). 

Merging: when multiple paths reach the Gateway, it simply allows the flow to continue without evaluating any conditions or making any synchronization.
