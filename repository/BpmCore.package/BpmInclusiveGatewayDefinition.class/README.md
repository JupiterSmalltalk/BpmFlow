(O)
An inclusive gateway breaks the process flow into one or more flows. An example of a inclusive gateway is business actions taken based on survey results.

Splitting: the flow will go down all the outgoing paths that meet the GatewayÂ’s conditions (there will be one per each path). 

Merging: it synchronizes all the paths where the process flow effectively reaches the gateway.
