(*)
As the name signifies, complex gateways are only used for the most complex flows in the business process. When possible, you should use a simpler gateway to do what needs to be done. If you need multiple gateways to describe the business flow, then that's an ideal case for the complex gateway. Complex gateways need more descriptive text because you're using words in place of symbols.

Splitting: the flow will go down one or more paths depending on the evaluation of a single condition specified for the Gateway. 

Merging: the Gateway synchronizes all incoming paths that meet a single condition specified for the Gateway.
